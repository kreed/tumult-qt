Music player with an out-of-your-face interface. All interaction is handled
through global keyboard shortcuts or the system tray icon. Tumult aims to make
music listening a passive activity that does not disrupt other actions.

=== BUILDING ===
Tumult is currently only available on X11 platforms (e.g. Linux). For details
see the TODO file.

Tumult supports two media backends: Phonon and QtMobility Multimedia.

The default is Phonon, which is included with Qt. Phonon is mature, however
development seems to have ceased and some annoying bugs are present.

QtMobility Multimedia is in development and thus does not yet support all platforms.
It does seem to work better on platforms it does support, however. To use it
export the path to it in the QT_MEDIA environment variable. For example:
"export QT_MEDIA=/path/to/qt-multimedia". QtMobility Multimedia can be downloaded
using Git from http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-mobility/multimedia

To build:
	qmake
	make
	sudo make install

=== CONFIGURATION ===
Currently all configuration is handled through an INI file located at
~/.config/Kreed.org/Tumult.conf. There are two sections in the
configuration: streams and keys.

The streams section is required. At least one stream must be specified for Tumult
to run. Streams are specified as key=value, where key is the stream name and
value is the source. Possible sources are URLs, m3u playlist and directories.

The keys section is optional. It specifies global shortcuts to be grabbed. Keys
are specified as key=value, where key is the action name and value a string
containing bracket-enclosed modifiers and the X11 keysym, e.g. "prev_stream=<Alt>J"
or "play_pause=XF86AudioPlay". Possible action names are play_pause, prev_stream,
next_stream, status, prev_in_stream, next_in_stream, clear_queue, and search.

See Tumult.conf.sample for an example configuration.

=== USAGE ===
Use the system tray icon or keyboard shortcuts to interact with Tumult.

Tumult splits music into "streams". Each stream contains one or more sources.
This mechanic is designed to make it easy to, for example, switch between an
internet radio station, a playlist, or an entire media library without being
bothered by a myriad of mouse clicks.

Sources in a stream may be added to a queue. Open the search box with the shortcut
or the "Add to Queue..." menu action and type a string. All sources with filenames
or sources containing the string will populate the queue. Sources in the queue will
be played before other sources in the stream.

(Anything else I should document/clarify?)
