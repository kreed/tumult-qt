- Get a global shortcut API in Qt and use that. This will allow Tumult to be
  cross-platform and simplify code qutie a bit.
- Ditto for idle time API
- Add a GUI configuration dialog. It should be trivial to add one for streams.
  For keyboard shortcuts it may be better to hold off until we have a Qt API
  for them.
- Support playlist formats other than m3u
- Show cover art in the status box
- Save song play count outside of the configuration file
